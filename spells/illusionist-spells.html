A sound of the caster’s choosing is con-
jured, emanating from a point anywhere
within range.
▶ Motion: The sound may move as long
as it remains within range.
▶ Change: The sound may change and
evolve over the course of the duration as
the caster wishes.
▶ Loudness: The loudness of the sound
is limited by the caster’s level: a maxi-
mum equivalent to approximately four
humans shouting per experience level.

<p>
Duration: Instant
Range: 60’
This spell conjures an orb of pure colour
that shoots towards a visible target within
range.
▶ Colour: The caster may conjure an orb
of one of the colours listed in the table
opposite, depending on their experience
level and the gems available.
▶ Gemstone: The colour orb is created
by refracting and amplifying the pure hue
and intrinsic properties of a gemstone,
which must be in the caster’s possession.
Casting chromatic orb does not cause the
gemstone to be consumed.
▶ Value: The gem to be used must be of
a certain minimum value (indicated in
the table opposite).
▶ Hit: The orb hits unerringly, inflicting
damage on the target and another effect
that depends on its colour.

<p>
Light: If the target fails a saving throw
versus spells, it is surrounded by light in
a 15’ radius for 1d4 rounds. In low light
conditions, attacks against the target
gain a +2 bonus. Any attempts at stealth
or surprise on the target’s part may be
nullified.
Heat: If the target fails a saving throw
versus spells, it suffers a –2 penalty to
attacks, saves, and AC for 1d4 rounds.
The heat of the ruby orb may also be used
to melt up to a cubic yard of ice.
Fire: All flammable objects within 2’ of
the target are set alight. If the target fails
a saving throw versus spells, flammable
objects (e.g. clothing, hair, etc.) on its
person are also set alight. This inflicts 1d3
damage for 1d4 rounds, unless the target
spends a round extinguishing the flames.
Blindness: The target is blinded for 1d4
rounds unless it saves versus spells. A
blind creature cannot attack.
Stench: A 5’ radius cloud of stinking
vapours erupts at the target’s location.
Creatures within the cloud (including
the target) must save versus poison or be
overcome with nausea—unable to act ex-
cept to move at half movement rate. Once
leaving the cloud, the nausea subsides
after 1d4 rounds. The cloud disperses
after 1 turn.
Magnetism: The electrical energy of the
orb strongly magnetizes any metal objects
on the target (e.g. armour, weapons) un-
less a saving throw versus spells is made.
The magnetic charge lasts for 1d4 rounds
and causes metal objects to stick together.
A target wearing metal armour suffers a
–2 penalty to AC and is unable to attack
with metal weapons.
Paralysis: Unless a saving throw versus
paralysis is made, the target is paralysed
for 1d4 rounds.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga2815f9">
<p>
Duration: 2d6 rounds +2 per level
Range: The caster
The caster is wrapped in an illusion, tak-
ing on the outward appearance of another
humanoid. Two variants are possible,
chosen as the spell is cast:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Imagined form: The caster takes on a</li>
</ol>
<p>
form which they imagine.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Duplicate individual: The caster</li>
</ol>
<p>
copies the form of a living individual
whom they touch. An attack roll is
required if the target is unwilling.
Stipulations: The following apply:
▶ Height: The illusionary form may be at
most 1’ taller or shorter than the caster’s
normal form.
▶ Weight: Apparent weight may be
altered in any way.
▶ Gear: Clothing or items may be al-
tered in any way.
▶ Observers: If the spell is used to copy
another’s appearance, those familiar with
the copied individual may save versus
spells to detect the ruse.

<h3 id="orgbbbd3ec">Hypnotism</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgbbbd3ec">
<p>
Duration: 1 round +1 per level
Range: 30’
The caster’s gestures and droning syllables
open the minds of one or more subjects
within range to a hypnotic suggestion
that is uttered as part of the spell casting.
▶ Number of targets: Up to 1d6
creatures are affected. The number of
creatures affected is determined after the
suggestion is made.
▶ Wording: The suggestion must take
the form of a short phrase (at most one
or two sentences) suggesting a course of
action to the subjects.
▶ Comprehension: A language that is
understood by the subjects must be used.
▶ Harmful suggestions: A suggested
course of action that is obviously harmful
to a subject causes the spell to automati-
cally fail for that subject.
▶ Saving throw: Each subject may save
versus spells to resist the hypnotic sug-
gestion. If the save fails, the subject will
follow the caster’s suggestion for up to the
duration of the spell.
▶ Reasonable suggestions: A suggestion
that is worded in such a way to make it
sound very reasonable incurs a –2 penal-
ty to the saving throw.
Restrictions: Undead are not affected by
hypnotism.

Duration: 6 turns +1 per level
Range: 120’
This spell has three usages:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Conjuring light: In a 15’ radius. The</li>
</ol>
<p>
magical light is sufficient for reading,
but is not as bright as daylight. The

which case the light moves with the
object.

<p>
cel a darkness spell (see below).

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga35f3e0">
<p>
Duration: Concentration
Range: 240’
A visual illusion of the caster’s choosing
manifests in a 20’ cube area. Three types
of illusions may be created:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>An illusionary monster: That can</li>
</ol>
<p>
be directed to attack. The monster
has AC 9 [10] and vanishes if hit in
combat.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>An illusionary attack: For example,</li>
</ol>
<p>
an avalanche, a falling ceiling, a magic
missile, etc. Targets who save versus
spells are unaffected.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>A scene: Either changing the appear-</li>
</ol>
<p>
ance of the affected area or creating
the appearance of something new. The
scene disappears if touched.
Stipulations: The following apply:
▶ Concentration: Is required to main-
tain the illusion. If the caster moves or
loses concentration, the spell ends.
▶ Illusionary monsters or attacks: May
appear to be harmful but never inflict
real damage. A character who appears to
die actually falls unconscious, a character
turned to stone will actually be paralysed,
and so on. Such effects last for 1d4 turns.
▶ Illusions from imagination: If the
illusion is of something the caster has not
personally seen, the referee should grant
targets a bonus to any applicable saving
throws.

By means of read magic, the caster can
decipher magical inscriptions or runes as
follows:
▶ Scrolls: The magical script of a scroll
of arcane spells can be understood. The
caster is then able to activate the scroll at
any time in the future.
▶ Spell books: A spell book written by
another arcane spell caster can be deci-
phered.
▶ Inscriptions: Runes or magical words
inscribed on an object or surface can be
understood.

read a magical inscription using read
magic, they are thereafter able to read that
particular writing without recourse to the
use of this spell.

er as a monster from its worst nightmares
and will flee from the caster at maximum
speed.

make a new save versus spells each
round with success indicating that the
spell is broken. Until the spell is broken,
the target believes it is being pursued by
the imagined horror.

<h3 id="orgb09bc9a">Fascinate</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb09bc9a">
<p>
Duration: See below
Range: 30’
This spell causes a single creature to per-
ceive the caster—whatever their normal
appearance—as utterly captivating.
▶ Restrictions: Creatures of less than
animal intelligence are not affected.
▶ Saving throw: The subject may save
versus spells to avoid the effect.
Affected subjects: Behave as follows:
▶ Besotted: The subject follows the cast-
er wherever they go, as if besotted, unless
doing so would present a serious danger.
▶ Obedience: If the caster can com-
municate with the subject (even if only
by gestures), it may obey requests. Each
time a request is made of the subject, the
caster must make a CHA check (possibly
penalised, if the request is against the
nature or best interests of the subject). If
the check fails, the spell is broken and the
target’s perception of the caster becomes
one of horror, rage, and hate.
▶ Animals: An animal remains fascinat-
ed for 1d4 days, after which it may either
attack the caster (if it has been mistreat-
ed) or simply leave. If the caster treated
the animal well, there is a percentage
chance equal to the caster’s CHA that
the animal will henceforth remain by the
character’s side of its own free will.

The pattern ceases to enthral it and it may
act next round.
Concentration: The caster can maintain
the pattern indefinitely as long as they
concentrate on the spell and remain
stationary.

Range: 240’
An illusion of the caster’s choosing—
including minor sounds (though not
speech)—manifests in a 20’ cube area.
Three types of illusions may be created:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>An illusionary monster: That can be</li>

tion, the spell ends.
▶ Persistence: Even when the caster
stops concentrating on the spell, the illu-
sion persists for two further rounds.
▶ Illusionary monsters or attacks: May
appear to be harmful but never inflict
real damage. A character who appears to
die actually falls unconscious, a character
turned to stone will actually be paralysed,
and so on. Such effects last for 1d4 turns.
▶ Illusions from imagination: If the
illusion is of something the caster has not
personally seen, the referee should grant
targets a bonus to any applicable saving
throws.

Over the course of one turn, the caster
weaves a semi-real but tangible object
from a tiny piece of constituent matter.
For example, a semi-real rope could be
formed from a strand of hemp fibre.
▶ Non-living: Only objects of non-liv-
ing vegetable matter may be created (e.g.
fabric, rope, wood, etc.).
▶ Size: The object may be no larger than
one cubic foot per level of the caster.
▶ Food: While it is possible to create
food, its semi-real nature means that it
provides no nourishment.
▶ When the duration ends: The con-
jured item disappears. The piece of matter
from which it was woven remains.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org8de807e">
<p>
Duration: 1 round per level
Range: 5’ per level
The subconscious fears of a single target
manifest in its mind as a vision of the
most horrible monstrosity it can imagine.
▶ Saving throw: The subject may save
versus spells with a +2 bonus to resist
the phantasm.
▶ Pursuit: The monster pursues the
subject relentlessly and, as it only exists in
the subject’s mind, can move at any speed
and pass through any obstacles.
▶ Invulnerability: The monster is invul-
nerable to all of the subject’s attacks.
▶ Attacks: The monster attacks the
subject once per round with a THAC0 of
16 [+3]. If one of the monster’s attacks is
successful, the subject dies of terror.
▶ Cancelling: Killing or knocking out
the caster ends the phantasm.
Restrictions: Undead and creatures of less
than animal intelligence are unaffected.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org2e34f10">
<p>
Duration: Concentration
Range: 30’ square around the caster
A band of twisting, interweaving, rain-
bow colours fills the air in a 30’ × 30’ area
centred on the caster.
▶ Creatures that see the pattern: Must
save versus spells or become hypnotised
as long as they are able to watch the
pattern.
▶ Number of creatures affected: A total
of up to 24 Hit Dice of creatures may be
hypnotised.
▶ Hypnotised creatures: Simply stand
still, gazing at the pattern of colours.
▶ If a hypnotised creature is harmed:
The pattern ceases to enthral it and it may
act next round.
Maintaining the pattern: The pattern
can be maintained and directed as fol-
lows:
▶ Concentration: The caster can main-
tain the pattern indefinitely, as long as
they concentrate on the spell and remain
stationary.
▶ Releasing: The caster may optionally
end concentration and direct the pattern
to drift away in a specified direction. The
pattern drifts at a rate of 30’ per round
and fades after 1d4 rounds. Hypnotised
creatures will do their best to follow the
pattern, but if they are led into a danger-
ous area, another saving throw versus
spells is allowed to snap out of the trance.

shadow monsters attack as normal and
inflict normal damage. They may use
any special or magical attack forms they
possess, but attacks such as energy drain

worst, they might cause an opponent to
fall unconscious or be paralysed for 1d4

An area is cloaked with a combination of
invisibility and illusion, making it seem

▶ Creatures: In the affected area when
the spell is cast are not cloaked.
▶ Inanimate objects: In the affected area
are cloaked with invisibility and are veiled

Duration: 1 round per level

An illusion of the caster’s choosing—

Three types of illusions may be created:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>An illusionary monster: That can be</li>
</ol>
<p>
directed to attack. The monster has
AC 5 [14]. If it is hit in combat, the
attacker may save versus spells. If the
save succeeds, the attacker realises the
illusory nature of the monster and can
no longer be harmed by it.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>An illusionary attack: For example,</li>
</ol>
<p>
an avalanche, a falling ceiling, a magic
missile, etc. Targets who save versus

<li>A scene: Either changing the appear-</li>

ance of the affected area or creating
the appearance of something new.
Stipulations: The following apply:
▶ Responsiveness: The illusion behaves
and responds as decided by the caster
when the spell is cast. No concentration
is required to maintain the illusion.
▶ Illusionary monsters or attacks: May
appear to be harmful but never inflict
real damage. A character who appears to
die actually falls unconscious, a character
turned to stone will actually be paralysed,
and so on. Such effects last for 1d4 turns.
▶ Illusions from imagination: If the
illusion is of something the caster has not
personally seen, the referee should grant
targets a bonus to any applicable saving
throws.

Duration: Up to 6 turns +1 per level
Range: 30’
The shadows cast by the light of a candle
are enchanted, causing them to re-enact
events which previously occurred in the
area where the spell is cast.
▶ Candle: The caster must light a candle
and place it in the centre of the area to
be affected, which must otherwise be
in darkness. The candle burns down com-
pletely over the spell’s duration.
▶ Time span: The caster may choose to
look back into the past up to six turns
plus one turn per level.
▶ Shadow play: Once the starting point
for the shadow re-enactment has been
selected, the spell lasts for that amount of
time, producing a shadowy replay of the
past up to the moment the spell was cast.
▶ Silhouettes: Only silhouettes of past
events in the area are produced; any
sound or speech which occurred is not
replicated.
Enhancement: The power of the illusion
may be enhanced by using a specially
manufactured candle:
▶ Special candle: The candle must be
formed from the earwax of a giant mon-
ster (which must be obtained by adven-
turing) and be inlaid with fine runes in
gold leaf (at a cost of 200gp).

shadow play is also accompanied by
sound, faintly reproduced in the sputter-

Duration: 1d4 rounds +1 per level
Range: The caster or a creature or object
touched
An object or creature touched becomes
shadowy and semi-ethereal.
If an object is touched:
▶ Insubstantial: The object becomes
utterly insubstantial. It cannot be touched
and provides no physical resistance. For
example, a door transformed by this spell
could be freely passed through.
▶ Size: The object may be no larger than
one cubic foot per level of the caster.
▶ Magical objects: Magic items and ob-
jects created by spells (e.g. a wall of stone)
cannot be targeted.
If a creature is touched:
▶ Insubstantial: The subject and
everything it carries becomes insubstan-
tial.
▶ Movement: The subject is able to pass
through small holes and cracks.
▶ Invulnerability: Only ethereal crea-
tures or magic may harm the subject.
▶ Pass undead: Undead will ignore the
subject, believing them to be a phantom
of some kind. Undead of 10 or more HD
may save versus spells (at a –4 penalty)
to notice the illusion.

may save versus spells to avoid the trans-
formation.

Range: 10’
This powerful spell warps the flow of time
in the location where it is cast.
▶ Time acceleration: For those within
the area of effect, each turn that passes
has the subjective effect of a whole hour.
Within the affected area, spell durations
pass more quickly and characters must
eat and sleep at the accelerated rate.
▶ Rest: If enough perceptual time is
spent in the affected area, hit points may
be recovered due to rest and spells may
be re-memorized, subject to the normal
rules.
▶ Interaction: Any interaction between
characters within the enchanted area and
those outside of it occur at the normal
rate—characters inside the area of time
distortion do not gain or lose actions in
combat, for instance.
▶ Usage limit: Casting time flow more
than once in the space of a week causes a

<h3 id="org0ab2796">Dream Quest</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0ab2796">
<p>
Duration: Permanent until fulfilled
Range: 60’
The caster commands a single subject to
perform a specific quest or task, conveyed
through a recurring dream.
▶ The dream: While the spell remains
in effect, the subject experiences the
recurring dream every time they sleep. In
the recurring dream, the subject witness-
es themselves completing the prescribed
quest.
▶ Examples of quests: Rescuing a pris-
oner, killing a specific monster, bringing
a magic item to the caster, or going on a
journey to an oracle.
▶ Suicidal quests: The prescribed quest
must not be obviously suicidal.
▶ Saving throw: The subject may save
versus spells, with success indicating that
the initial dream is experienced but the
spell has no further effect.
▶ Refusal: The subject must undertake
the quest or begin to fade from reality.
Every day in which the subject does not
pursue the quest, they lose 1 hit point.
This damage cannot be fatal (e.g. if the
subject has only 1 hit point, no further
loss due to this spell will occur). Howev-
er, accrued damage cannot be healed by
any means except completing the quest.
▶ Completion: Once the task is com-
pleted, the spell ends. Any lost hit points

Duration: 1 turn per level
Range: The caster or a person touched
The subject takes on the appearance of a
person of the caster’s choosing.
▶ Appearance: The subject becomes
physically indistinguishable from the
selected individual, becoming the same
height, age, race, sex, etc.
▶ Manner: Even the subject’s gestures,
voice, mode of speech, and mannerisms
are rendered identical to those of the
mimicked target.
▶ Mind: The subject does not gain any of
the memories, mental faculties, experi-
ences, or abilities of the target.
▶ Observers: Who know the mimicked
target may save versus spells to detect
the illusion if the subject does or says
anything that the original would not.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd14a0fe">
<p>
Duration: Varies by manifestation (see
examples below)
Range: The caster
This spell harnesses the malleable, im-
aginative potency of the dream world,
manifesting the caster’s wish.
▶ Dreaming: After casting the spell, the
caster must lie down and drift off to sleep
while visualising the desired manifes-
tation. The visualisation will then be
taken up by the caster’s subconscious and
experienced as a potent dream.
▶ Upon awakening: If the caster sleeps
for an uninterrupted 8 hours, the desired
manifestation comes to pass.
Potency: While manifest dream can bring
about a wide range of effects, its power is
not unlimited. The following are exam-
ples of the maximum potency of the spell:
▶ Healing: All of an individual’s wounds.
▶ Regeneration: Of a lost body part (e.g.
a hand or foot).
▶ Revelation: Of a route through the
wilderness, a secret entrance into a
fortress, or the location of a lost item. (As
long as the sought location or object is
not warded by magic.)
▶ Divination: Of the approximate
strength of enemy forces. (Creatures of
7 or more Hit Dice in the force may save
versus spells to avoid being detected in
this way.)
▶ Temporary restoration: Of a dead
creature or destroyed object for 1 turn
per level of the caster.
Usage limit: This spell may be used at
most once per week. A caster who over-
steps this limit will become permanently
insane.

<h3 id="org1e7f459">Mass Suggestion</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org1e7f459">
<p>
Duration: 4 turns +4 per level
Range: 90’
The caster utters a suggestion to influence
the behaviour of selected subjects within
range.
▶ Number of subjects: Up to one subject
per level of the caster may be targeted.
▶ Wording: The suggestion must take
the form of a short phrase (at most one
or two sentences) suggesting a course of
action to the subjects.
▶ Comprehension: A language that is
understood by the subjects must be used.
▶ Harmful suggestions: Suggestions
that are obviously harmful to a subject
cause the spell to automatically fail for
that subject.
▶ Saving throw: A save versus spells
is allowed to resist the suggestion. If
the save fails, the subject will follow the
caster’s suggestion for up to the duration
of the spell.
▶ Reasonable suggestions: A suggestion
that is worded in such a way to make it
sound very reasonable incurs a –2 penal-
ty to the saving throw.
Restrictions: Undead are unaffected.

Duration: 1 round per level
Range: The caster
This spell causes an illusory double of the
caster to appear while the real caster is
rendered invisible.
▶ Appearance: The illusion of the dou-
ble includes visual, sonic, olfactory, and
tactile elements. It is an entirely convinc-
ing double of the caster.
▶ Action: The double may act com-
pletely independently, including moving,
speaking, attacking, and casting spells
(that the caster has memorized).
▶ Combat: The double has the same
combat capabilities as the caster and has a
separate pool of hit points, equal to those
of the caster when the spell is cast.
The caster: Is rendered invisible as
follows:
▶ Attacking: The caster may attack while
invisible.
▶ Being attacked: Opponents who are
aware of the caster’s presence (but who
cannot see invisible) may detect a faint
shimmering, allowing them to locate the
caster. The caster gains a +4 bonus to AC
and saving throws against such attacks.
▶ Equipment: Any gear the caster is
carrying is also rendered invisible (this
includes clothing and armour). Items
dropped or put down become visible.
▶ Light sources: If a light source is made
invisible (as part of the caster’s gear), the
light it casts is unaffected.

<h3 id="org979eb72">Permanent Illusion</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org979eb72">
<p>
Duration: Permanent
Range: 240’
An illusion of the caster’s choosing—
including sounds, smells, and thermal
elements—manifests in a 20’ cube area.
Two types of illusions may be created:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>An illusionary monster: That can be</li>
</ol>
<p>
directed to attack. The monster has
AC 5 [14]. If it is hit in combat, the
attacker may save versus spells. If the
save succeeds, the attacker realises the
illusory nature of the monster and can
no longer be harmed by it.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>A scene: Either changing the appear-</li>
</ol>
<p>
ance of the affected area or creating
the appearance of something new.
Stipulations: The following apply:
▶ Responsiveness: The illusion behaves
and responds as decided by the caster
when the spell is cast.
▶ Illusionary monsters: May appear to
be harmful but never inflict real damage.
A character who appears to die actually
falls unconscious, a character turned to
stone will actually be paralysed, and so
on. Such effects last for 1d4 turns.
▶ Illusions from imagination: If the
illusion is of something the caster has not
personally seen, the referee should grant
targets a bonus to any applicable saving
throws.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge36174e">
<p>
Duration: 1 round per level
Range: 30’
The caster conjures one or more semi-re-
al monsters, woven from shadow-stuff.
▶ Hit Dice: The monsters’ total Hit Dice
may not exceed the caster’s level.
▶ Type: All monsters must be of the
same type.
▶ Hit points: The monsters have 1d6 hit
points per Hit Die (instead of the normal
1d8 hit points per Hit Die).
▶ Control: The monsters are under the
caster’s control.
Saving throw: Every creature viewing the
shadow monsters may save versus spells:
▶ If the save succeeds: The subject views
the monsters as they truly are: vague,
shifting forms of shadow. To this subject,
the shadow monsters have AC 9 [10]
and inflict three quarters of their normal
damage (rounding down). This subject
is unaffected by any special or magical
attack forms of the monsters.
▶ If the save fails: The subject per-
ceives the monsters as real creatures
of the chosen type. To this subject, the
shadow monsters attack as normal and
inflict normal damage. They may use
any special or magical attack forms they
possess, but attacks such as energy drain
or petrification do not really occur—at
worst, they might cause an opponent to
fall unconscious or be paralysed for 1d4
turns.

<h3 id="orgd666709">Through the Looking Glass</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd666709">
<p>
Duration: 1 round per level
Range: 10’
A finely wrought, full-length, silver
mirror is enchanted to act as a scrying
device, allowing the caster to view any
place or object that is brought to mind:
▶ The clarity of the vision: Depends on
the scryer’s familiarity with the subject.
▶ Casting spells: Through the mirror
into the viewed scene is not possible.
Stepping into the mirror: The caster may
step into the divined scene:
▶ Portal: A faint, spatial distortion exists
at the point at which the caster entered
the scene. The portal is invisible, but may
be perceived by the caster or by magic.
▶ Stepping back through: Anyone who
perceives the portal may step out of the
mirror and into the location whence the
caster originated.
▶ At the end of the spell’s duration: The
portal disappears. Any creature (includ-
ing the caster) that stepped through the
portal/mirror and did not return must
save versus death or becomes lost in
another plane of reality.
Material cost: The mirror must be of at
least 5,000gp value.

<h3 id="orga8c03c6">Triggered Illusion</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga8c03c6">
<p>
Duration: Permanent until triggered,
then 1 round per level
Range: 240’
An area within range is enchanted to pro-
duce an illusion of the caster’s choosing
—including sounds, smells, and thermal
elements—when a specified triggering
condition occurs. Once triggered, the
illusion manifests in a 20’ cube area, re-
maining for up to 1 round per level. The
enchantment then ends. Three types of
illusions may be created:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>An illusionary monster: That can be</li>
</ol>
<p>
directed to attack. The monster has
AC 5 [14]. If it is hit in combat, the
attacker may save versus spells. If the
save succeeds, the attacker realises the
illusory nature of the monster and can
no longer be harmed by it.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>An illusionary attack: For example,</li>
</ol>
<p>
an avalanche, a falling ceiling, a magic
missile, etc. Targets who save versus
spells are unaffected.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>A scene: Either changing the appear-</li>
</ol>
<p>
ance of the affected area or creating
the appearance of something new. The
scene disappears if touched.
Stipulations: The following apply:
▶ Responsiveness: The illusion behaves
and responds as decided by the caster
when the spell is cast.
▶ Illusionary monsters: May appear to
be harmful but never inflict real damage.
A character who appears to die actually
falls unconscious, a character turned to

on. Such effects last for 1d4 turns.
▶ Illusions from imagination: If the
illusion is of something the caster has not
personally seen, the referee should grant
targets a bonus to any applicable saving
throws.
The trigger condition: May be as broad
or as specific as the caster wishes, and
may include conditions on objects in the
enchanted area being touched or on the
presence of creatures in the area. It may
only take visual appearances into account
(e.g. it cannot discern the alignment,
class, level, etc. of creatures who pass
through).

<h3 id="org63e6c4a">Vision</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org63e6c4a">
<p>
Duration: 1 turn
Range: The caster
The caster calls upon a supernatural pow-
er, asking to be sent a vision in answer to
a question which vexes them.
▶ The power to be called upon: May be
selected by the caster.
▶ Sacrifice: In order to supplicate the
power being contacted, the caster must
sacrifice something either valuable to
themselves or valuable to the supernat-
ural power. More valuable sacrifices in-
crease the chance of the caster’s question
being answered (see below).
The response of the power: Is deter-
mined by rolling 2d6:
▶ 2–6: The power is angered. No vision
is sent. Instead, the caster is placed under
a powerful enchantment forcing them to
perform some quest for the power.
▶ 7–9: A minor vision is sent. It may not
be directly related to the caster’s question.
▶ 10 or higher: A vision that answers
the caster’s question is sent.
Value of sacrifice: The 2d6 roll is
modified by the value of the sacrifice (as
judged by the referee):
▶ Very precious: +1
▶ Extremely precious: +2
▶ Priceless: +3
