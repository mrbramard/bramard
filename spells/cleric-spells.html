Range: 480’

<h3 id="org2b8a094">Quest</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org2b8a094">
<p>
Duration: Until quest is completed /
Instant (remove quest)
Range: 30’
The caster commands a single subject to
perform a specific quest or task.
▶ Examples: Rescuing a prisoner, killing
a specific monster, bringing a magic item
to the caster, or going on a journey to a
holy site.
▶ Suicidal quests: The prescribed quest
must not be obviously suicidal.
▶ Saving throw: The subject may save
versus spells, with success indicating that
the quest has no effect.
▶ Refusal: Otherwise, the subject must
undertake the quest or fall under a curse
(per the curse spell, with the exact nature
of the curse determined by the referee).
▶ Completion: Once the task is com-
pleted, the spell ends.
Reversed: Remove Quest
Can dispel an active quest spell. If the
character who cast the quest spell to be
nullified is higher level than the character
casting remove quest, there is a chance of
the spell having no effect. The probabil-
ity of failure is 5% per level the caster is
below the caster of quest.

<h3 id="orgac429a7">Raise Dead</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgac429a7">
<p>
Duration: Instant
Range: 120’
This spell has two uses:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Restore life: To a recently deceased</li>
</ol>
<p>
human or demihuman. See below.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Destroy undead: A single undead</li>
</ol>
<p>
monster is destroyed, if it fails a saving
throw versus spells.
Restoring life: When used to restore life,
the following stipulations apply:
▶ Time limit: The caster can raise a per-
son that has been dead for no longer than
four days per level of the caster above 7th.
For example, a 10th level caster can revive
a character that has been dead for twelve
days (three levels above 7th × four days).
▶ Weakness: Returning from death is
an ordeal. Until the subject gets two full
weeks of bed rest, they have 1 hit point,
move at half the normal rate, cannot
carry heavy items, and cannot attack, cast
spells, or use other class abilities. This
period of weakness may not be shortened
by any magical healing.
Reversed: Finger of Death
Directs a ray of deadly magic at a single
target. If the target fails a saving throw
versus death, it dies instantly. Casting
finger of death is a chaotic act; it will only
be used by lawful casters in desperate
situations.
