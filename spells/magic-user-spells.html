HD are affected first.
▶ HD: Treat monsters with less than 1
HD as having 1 HD and monsters with
a fixed hit point bonus as having the flat
HD. (For example, a 3+2 HD monster
would be treated as having 3 HD.)

sufficient to affect a creature are wasted.

of illusions may be created:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>An illusionary monster: That can be</li>

Stipulations: The following apply:
▶ Concentration: Is required to main-
tain the illusion. If the caster moves or
loses concentration, the spell ends.
▶ Illusionary monsters or attacks: May
appear to be harmful but no real dam-
age is ever inflicted. A character who
appears to die actually falls unconscious,
a character turned to stone will actually
be paralysed, and so on. Such effects last
for 1d4 turns.
▶ Illusions from imagination: If the
illusion is of something the caster has not
personally seen, the referee should grant
targets a bonus to any applicable saving
throws.

planes are home to more powerful and
knowledgeable beings.
▶ Questions: The caster may then ask a
number of simple yes/no questions equal
to the number of the plane contacted. The
referee plays the role of the contacted be-
ing, responding to the caster’s questions.
▶ Answers: For each question asked,
there is a chance of the contacted being
not knowing the answer or of answering
untruthfully: see the table to the right. It
is impossible to detect whether the entity
is lying.
Restrictions: Casting contact higher plane
is a great and perilous deed.
▶ Usage limit: It may be cast at most
once per week. (The referee may limit
the spell’s usage to even less frequently, if
desired.)
▶ Insanity: Communion with other-
worldly beings of great power can shatter
the caster’s sanity. The basic chance is
shown in the table above. For every
level of the caster above 11, this chance
is reduced by 5%. If the caster is driven
insane as a result of the communion, the
recovery time is a number of weeks equal
to the number of the plane contacted.

Duration: Special
Range: The caster
The caster’s body enters a comatose
trance as their life-force is transferred
into a receptacle (any inanimate object
within 30’), known as a magic jar. From
there, the caster may attempt to possess
the bodies of other creatures.
When the caster’s life-force is in the
magic jar:
▶ Possession: The caster may attempt
to possess the body of another creature
within 120’. The victim may save versus
spells to resist possession. If the save
is successful, the caster may not make
another attempt to possess that victim for
one turn. If the save fails, the caster’s life-
force leaves the magic jar and enters the
victim, possessing it.
▶ Returning: The caster may choose
to return to their own body at any time,
ending the spell.
▶ If the magic jar is destroyed: The
caster dies.
▶ If the caster’s own body is destroyed:
Their life-force is stranded in the magic
jar.
When the caster’s life-force is possess-
ing a victim:
▶ Control: The caster gains full control
over the victim’s body, but is not able to
make the victim cast spells.
▶ If the magic jar is destroyed: The spell
ends and the caster’s life-force is trapped
in the possessed body.
▶ If the possessed victim is killed: The
caster’s life-force returns to the magic jar.
▶ Dispelling: Dispel evil forces the cast-
er’s life-force back into the magic jar.
▶ If the caster’s own body is destroyed:
Their life-force is stranded in the body of
the creature being possessed.

teleport the subject into mid-air or into
solid matter.)

this location already be occupied by solid
matter, the subject is instantly killed.
Otherwise, the subject falls from a height.
Too low: The subject appears in the
ground and is killed instantly.
Knowledge of destination: The caster’s
knowledge of the destination is rated as
follows:
▶ Scant: A location that the caster has
visited once or twice, has seen by magical
scrying, or has heard of from descrip-
tions.
▶ Moderate: A location that the caster
has visited often or has studied via scry-
ing for several weeks.

Duration: Concentration
Range: 240 yards around the caster
By concentrating (no movement al-
lowed), the caster causes one of the
following conditions to manifest around
themselves. This spell only functions
outdoors.
▶ Calm: Clears bad weather (though
side-effects—e.g. mud after rain—re-
main.)
▶ Extreme heat: Dries up snow or mud
(including transmute rock to mud). Crea-
tures in the area move at half normal rate.
▶ Fog: Visibility drops to 20’. Creatures
in the fog move at half their normal rate.
At the referee’s option, they may also have
a chance of getting lost.
▶ High winds: Movement rates are
halved. Missile fire and flight are impos-
sible. High winds may be used to increase
the sailing speed of ships by 50%, if they
travel with the wind. In sandy areas, may
cause a sandstorm, reducing visibility to
20’.
208
▶ Rain: –2 penalty to missile attacks.
Mud forms in 3 turns, halving movement
rates.
▶ Snow: Visibility drops to 20’. Move-
ment rates are halved. Bodies of water
may freeze. After the snow thaws, mud
remains and still impedes movement.
▶ Tornado: The caster can direct the
tornado, which moves at 120’ per round.
The tornado can be directed to attack (see
stats below). Ships caught in a tornado
have a 75% chance of suffering 12 points
of hull damage.

Range: 30’
The caster commands a subject to perform
or avoid performing a specific action.
▶ Examples: Bringing a specific item
to the caster, eating or drinking without
restraint, keeping a certain fact secret.
▶ Impossible or deadly tasks: The
prescribed geas must not be impossible or
directly deadly—if such a geas is cast, it
affects the caster, instead.
▶ Saving throw: The subject may save
versus spells, to avoid coming under the
spell’s effect.
▶ If the save fails: The subject must
follow the stipulated course of action or
suffer gradually increasing (and eventu-
ally fatal) penalties determined by the ref-
eree (e.g. penalties to attack, ability score
reductions, inability to memorize spells,
physical torment and feebleness, etc.).
Reversed: Remove Geas
Can dispel an active geas spell and any
incurred penalties. If the caster of the
geas to be nullified is higher level than the
character casting remove geas, there is a
chance of the spell having no effect. The
probability of spell failure is 5% per level
the caster is below the caster of geas.

An invisible stalker (see below) is

with the wording of the mission. Invisible
stalkers are treacherous and, unless the
assigned mission can be easily and quick-
ly accomplished, will follow the letter of
the command while twisting the intent.
▶ Duration: The creature is bound to
attempt the mission until it succeeds or is

banish an invisible stalker, ending the

A dead character is returned to life in a

the Reincarnated Class table below.
The roll indicates either a character class

experience level 1d6 (or at most the same
level as the character achieved before
death). The reincarnated character can
continue to gain experience and advance
as normal, in the new class.
▶ Monster: The type should be deter-
mined by the referee. The monster should
be at least partially intelligent, have no
greater Hit Dice than the level of the
character being reincarnated (at most 6
HD), and be of the same alignment. The
tables opposite may be used, or the refer-
ee may create their own tables. Monsters

flesh. It is especially useful for restoring
life to a petrified creature and its equip-

ing all gear and any items currently held.
A saving throw versus paralysis is per-
mitted to resist the transformation.
